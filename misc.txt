Will need to install SonarQube locally or use SonarCloud.io in order to see the dashboard of metrics.

If installed locally then you will need to generate an access token and include it in the mvn sonar:sonar command. When you set the project up in SonarQube local it will allow you to generate a token. Alternatively you can create a settings.xml file in the .m2 directory with the location of the sonarqube server and access token.
